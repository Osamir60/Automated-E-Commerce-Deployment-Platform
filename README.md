Project Type: Cloud-Native DevOps Automation Project  

---

# Phase 1 – Version Control & AWS Foundations  
📅 16-2 → 28-2 (13 Days)

## Objectives
- Initialize Git repository and define branching strategy.
- Structure project folders and naming conventions.
- Learn core AWS networking & compute services:
  - EC2 (Virtual Servers)
  - RDS (Managed Databases)
  - S3 (Object Storage)
  - ELB (Load Balancing)
- Manually provision AWS infrastructure to understand architecture flow.

## Deliverables
- Initialized GitHub repository
- Manual AWS environment deployed
- Basic architecture documentation

---

# Phase 2 – Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
📅 1-3 → 15-3 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Learn Terraform state management, providers, and modules.
- Write modular Terraform code for:
  - VPC
  - EC2
  - RDS
  - S3
  - ELB
- Configure remote backend for state storage.
- Validate full infra creation & destruction cycle.

## Deliverables
- Automated AWS provisioning using Terraform
- Modular infrastructure codebase
- Reproducible infrastructure environment

---

# Phase 3 – Configuration Management (Ansible)  
📅 16-3 → 30-3 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Learn Ansible playbooks, inventory, and roles.
- Integrate Terraform outputs with Ansible inventory.
- Automate EC2 configuration:
  - Install Docker
  - Install dependencies
  - Configure base system settings
- Ensure idempotent configuration.

## Deliverables
- Automated server configuration
- Fully prepared EC2 environment for containers

---

# Phase 4 – Containerization (Docker)  
📅 31-3 → 14-4 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Study Docker images, containers & multi-stage builds.
- Containerize microservices:
  - Frontend
  - Backend API
  - Payment Service
  - Search Service
- Implement Docker Compose for local orchestration.
- Validate inter-service communication.

## Deliverables
- Optimized Dockerfiles
- Working Docker Compose setup
- Validated microservices networking

---

# Phase 5 – Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)  
📅 15-4 → 10-5 (26 Days)

## Objectives
- Deep dive into Kubernetes architecture.
- Deploy:
  - Pods
  - Deployments
  - Services
  - ConfigMaps & Secrets
- Implement Ingress configuration.
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
- Perform scaling validation under load.

## Deliverables
- Fully deployed Kubernetes application
- Working autoscaling mechanism
- Secure configuration management

---

# Phase 6 – Routing & Reverse Proxy (Nginx)  
📅 11-5 → 25-5 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Configure Nginx reverse proxy.
- Implement traffic routing & load balancing.
- Configure HTTPS (SSL).
- Optional: Deploy Nginx as Kubernetes Ingress Controller.

## Deliverables
- Stable public endpoint
- Secure traffic routing configuration

---

# Phase 7 – Continuous Integration & Deployment (Jenkins)  
📅 26-5 → 15-6 (21 Days)

## Objectives
- Install and configure Jenkins.
- Write Declarative Jenkinsfile.
- Implement CI/CD stages:
  1. Code checkout
  2. Docker image build
  3. Push to registry
  4. Deploy to Kubernetes
- Implement rollback strategy.
- Test pipeline automation.

## Deliverables
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- Auto-deployment to Kubernetes
- Rollback tested successfully

---

# Phase 8 – Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus & Grafana)  
📅 16-6 → 30-6 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection.
- Deploy Grafana dashboards.
- Monitor:
  - Kubernetes cluster
  - Application pods
  - Nginx
- Configure alerting rules.

## Deliverables
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Active alerting system
- Full infrastructure visibility

---

# Phase 9 – Full Integration & Testing  
📅 1-7 → 15-7 (15 Days)

## Objectives
- Integrate all components:
  - Terraform → Infrastructure
  - Ansible → Configuration
  - Jenkins → Deployment
  - Kubernetes → Orchestration
  - Grafana → Monitoring
- Conduct load testing.
- Validate autoscaling.
- Simulate deployment failure and test rollback.

## Deliverables
